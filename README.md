# Data-Science-Coursera :speech_balloon:

This repository contains the work submitted for the Data Science Specialization - John Hopkins University. The number and type of files are varied, so look at the file names carefully.  

The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) folder contains projects for week 1 and week 4 of the EDA class. Here you will find the dataset, script files, plot figures, and a README file that includes variable descriptions. 

If you're looking for the Final Project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course, go to the UCI HAR Final Project folder where you'll find the datasets, the code book, and the script files.

The Quiz Answers folder contains the script for the weekly assignments. The Possible fun projects folder is a personal folder where I store potential project ideas.
