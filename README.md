# Data-Science-Coursera

This repository contains the work submitted for the Data Science Specialization - John Hopkins University. The number and type of files are varied, so look at the file names carefully.  

If you're looking for the Final Project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course, go to the UCI HAR Final Project folder where you'll find the datasets, the code book, and the script files.

The Quiz Answers folder contains the script for the weekly assignments. The Possible fun projects folder is a personal folder where I store potential project ideas.
